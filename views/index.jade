      +eventItem('Camping', 'camping.jpg')
        p We are not a club or a Sunday school class, but a school of the woods.
      +eventItem('Community Involvement', 'civics.jpg')
        p We must change boys from a &lsquo;what can I get&rsquo; to a &lsquo;what can I give&rsquo; attitude.
      +eventItem('Marksmanship', 'marksman.jpg')
        p The Scout is not governed by #[strong don’t], but is led by #[strong do].

        p A fisherman does not bait his hook with food he likes. He uses food the fish likes. So with Scouts.

        p The real way to gain happiness is to give it to others.
      +eventItem('Patriotism', 'parade_marching.jpg')
        p Loyalty is a feature in a boy’s character that inspires boundless hope.

      +eventItem('Hiking', 'hiking.jpg')
        p Where is there a boy to whom the call of the wild and the open road does not appeal?
      +eventItem('Summer Camp', 'summer_camp.jpg')
        p A week of camp life is worth six months of theoretical teaching in the meeting room.
      +eventItem('Fun and Games', 'gaga.jpg')
        p Vigorous Scout games are the best form of physical education because most of them bring in moral education.
      +eventItem('First Aid', 'first_aid.jpg')
        p The most important object in Boy Scout training is to educate, not instruct
