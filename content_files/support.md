# Thank You For Your Support

Troop 151 conducts an annual Poinsettia sale in the fall, and a floral sale in the spring.
Your support helps us purchase equipment and pays for camping fees to develop a quality program for our Scouts.

Watch for our next sale. In the meantime, our tip jar is always open.
