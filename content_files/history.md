# Troop History

Troop 151 has had multiple incarnations, all at Marple Presbyterian Church.

The most recent began in 2009 when a Den of Webelos from Pack 151 was looking for an alternative to the other Troops in Broomall. Mike Maguire, Joe Arico and Deb Walter made up the original Key 3 for the Troop.

In 2015, Chris Pilko took over as Scoutmaster until work took him away from the Troop in 2020.

Mike Pilko has continued on as Scoutmaster since then.
